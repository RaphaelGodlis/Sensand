## OpenCVWrapper

Using the OpenCV functions which write their output to ``vector<vector<something>>``
causes crashes in UE4 because of some custom delete mechanism of the engine.

It has been reported however that performing those operations in a separate shared library
prevents the crashes, as the UE4's delete is not used.

This shared library is a wrapper around Aruco marker detection mechanism.
