# Sensand

Welcome to the Sensand Project!

Before you get started, make sure you have Unreal Engine 4, Sourcetree and Visual Studios installed on your PC.

Please read the Github Wiki before any work has begun, as it's important that you have a solid understanding of gitflow 
to avoid conflicting with other people's work. 

Good luck!
